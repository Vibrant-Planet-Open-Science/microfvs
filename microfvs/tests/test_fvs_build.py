    Test to confirm each FVS regional variant has been built successfully.

    Creates a keyfile in a temporary directory and runs it, confirming that:
        1. The FVS executable exists
        2. The keyfile for testing the FVS variant exists.
        3. The execution of FVS generated an *.out file

        5. The *.out file didn't include an error
        6. The return code from executing FVS was 0 (successful)

    Removes the FVS *.out file as well.
