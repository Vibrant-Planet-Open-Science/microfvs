** MANUAL TREATMENT - THINNING (MTTH)
** Treatment is generally consistently and equally applied across an area and is
** focused on significantly reducing the effects of high intensity fire by
** increasing heterogeneity into the existing forest structure.This treatment is
** expected to introduce a moderate level of structural variability mostly
** accomplished as a byproduct from implementation. This treatment may include
** biomass removal, commercial tree removal or combination of both. Treatment is
** complex due to many factors such as steep slope and the necessity of
** specialized equipment such as cable, tethered or helicopter logging methods.
** Canopy cover is affected by approximately 15%. dominant vegetation is
** affected by 5%. Codominant vegetation is affected by 40%. Subdominant
** vegetation is affected by 75%. Herbaceous vegetation is disturbed by as much
** as 10%. Soil is disturbed by as much as 10%. Basal area predictor variable
** for drought intensity modeling is â‰¤20 square meters per hectare.
**
** COMPONENTS
** --  THINNING & PRUNING OPERATIONS
**     Thin to a residual relative density (Curtis RD) of 30, with 90% cutting
**     efficiency and limited to trees with DBH between 1-12". Prune residual
**     trees such that height to base of live crown is at least 8 ft.
** --  FUEL TREATMENT OPERATIONS
**     Pile burn surface fuel one year after thinning and pruning, piling 70% of
**     fuels, killing 5% of small trees, and no trees killed with DBH >= 3".
